Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

    - answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
    - answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.

## Example 1 : 

    Input: n = 2  ==> [1, 2]
    Output: answer = ["1","2"] because 1 and 2 are not divisible by 3 or by 5

## Example 2 : 

    Input: n = 9  ==> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    Output: answer = ["1","2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz"]
