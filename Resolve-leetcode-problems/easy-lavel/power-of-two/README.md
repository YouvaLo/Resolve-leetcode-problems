# Exercice 7 : Power Of Two 

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

## Example1 : 

    Input: n = 8
    Output: true, because 8 = 2^x and x=3 and x is an integer   

## Example2 : 

    Input: n = 9
    Output: true, because 9 = 2^x, but x is not an Integer
