# Exercice 6 : Hamming weight --> Number of set(1) bits

Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

NB : set bit is 1 

## Example : 

    Input: n = 31
    Output: numberOfSetBits = 5, because 31 in binary (base2) is 11111
