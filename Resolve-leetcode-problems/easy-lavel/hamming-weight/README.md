# Exercice 6 : Hamming weight : Number of set(1) bits ([Hamming Weight LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/))

Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

NB : set bit is 1

## Example : 

    Input: n = 31
    Output: numberOfSetBits = 5, because 31 in binary (base2) is 11111
